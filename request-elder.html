				<h3>Things to know before making a request</h3>
				<p>There are certain teachings that need to be understood  before making a request for an Elder. In order to maintain the strong  relationship that has developed between the Elders and Camosun  the  following should be adhered to:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>All requests for Elders must go through the  Elders Coordinator. This helps to ensure that all requests are made in an  appropriate way that is consistent with Elder(s) culture and/or ways of being.</li>
                  <li>Elders receive an honorarium for their time. The  honorarium is $50 per hour, up to $200 per day. There are certain circumstances  in which the honorarium might be higher. For example, some ceremonies will require  more preparation time and/or travel time. If your department or event doesn&rsquo;t  have a budget for this please discuss this with the Elders Coordinator.</li>
                  <li>When you invite an Elder to your class, event,  and/or meeting it is very important that you arrange to meet the Elder with a  parking pass. It is important that our Elders get to and from the class, event,  and/or meeting without stress or worry.</li>
                  <li>While the Elder receives an honorarium for their  time it is common practice to give a small gift of appreciation for the  knowledge that the Elder(s) is sharing. The gift could be a signed card of  appreciation, a department-specific gift, a small blanket, something  traditional from your own culture, or something that you have made. The gift is  about reciprocity and thanks. If you require help please contact the Elders  Coordinator.</li>
                  <li>Please be sure to have water and/or food  available for the Elder depending on the length of time they will be with you. </li>
                  <li>If you are inviting an Elder(s) to an event with  a meal be sure to serve the Elders first. Some Elders may want to serve  themselves so it is best to ask.</li>
                  <li>While you may know and understand the teachings  used in one territory, please be aware that Camosun operates in Coast  and Straits Salish territory and as such we work to follow the teachings of  this place and its peoples. If you are unsure of anything please contact  the Elders Coordinator.</li>
                  <li>If you are meeting with an Elder be sure to  leave plenty of time because it is up to the Elder when the meeting is  finished. That being said, the Elders do understand the way the modern world works and take that into account.</li>
